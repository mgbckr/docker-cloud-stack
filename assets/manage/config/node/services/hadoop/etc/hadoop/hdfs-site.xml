    <property>
        <description>
            Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name node should store the name table(fsimage). If this is a comma-delimited list of directories then the name table is replicated in all of the directories, for redundancy.

        <description>
            Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS secondary name node should store the temporary images to merge. If this is a comma-delimited list of directories then the image is replicated in all of the directories for redundancy.

    <property>
        <description>
            Determines where on the local filesystem an DFS data node should store its blocks. If this is a comma-delimited list of directories, then data will be stored in all named directories, typically on different devices. The directories should be tagged with corresponding storage types ([SSD]/[DISK]/[ARCHIVE]/[RAM_DISK]) for HDFS storage policies. The default storage type will be DISK if the directory does not have a storage type tagged explicitly. Directories that do not exist will be created if local filesystem permission allows.
